Demos
=====

Cortex has several command-line demos of functionality.
If the ``basic`` dataset was installed using ``cortex-setup``, then the
following demos are available:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cortex-classifier-demo

   $ cortex-rbm-demo

   $ cortex-vae-demo

If you installed the neuroimaging data, then the neuroimaging demos can be run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cortex-rbm-vbm-demo

    $ cortex-rbm-olin-demo

These are partial datasets used for demo purposes only.
